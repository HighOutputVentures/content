# Software Development Workflow

## Issue Types

### Epic
- Created by a `Software Project Manager`.
- Represents a scope of requirement or deliverable that is broken down into child tasks (`Story` or `Task`).
- The `Epic` also describes the purpose of the requirement or deliverable and how it will impact the product.
- Other important details such as 3rd-party integration credentials, API documentation, and other relevant resource materials are also added to the `Epic`.
