# Guidelines

## General Contribution Guidelines

1. Ensure that all content is finalized and ready for publication. Avoid including placeholder or temporary content, such as empty pages or lorem ipsum text, in the final version.

2. Use GitBook locally and run the command `gitbook serve` to preview your work. You can check the full instructions [here](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/blob/master/docs/setup.md#local-installation).

3. Don't forget to update the [SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md) file to make your new pages appear on the GitBook site.
